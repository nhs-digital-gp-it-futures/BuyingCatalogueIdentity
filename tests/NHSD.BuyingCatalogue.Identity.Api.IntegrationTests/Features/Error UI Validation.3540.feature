Feature: Error UI Validation
    As an Authority User
    I want to see the error page
    So that I know when something has gone wrong

    Background: 
    Given Organisations exist
        | Name           | OdsCode |
        | Organisation 1 | Ods 1   |
    And Users exist
        | Id  | OrganisationName | FirstName | LastName | Email         | PhoneNumber | Disabled | Password          |
        | 123 | Organisation 1   | John      | Doe      | test@user.com | 01234567890 | false    | testingtesting123 |
    When the user navigates to a restricted web page
    Then the user is redirected to page identity/account/login
    When the redirect URL is modified to be invalid
    Then the user is redirected to page identity/account/login
    When a login request is made with email address test@user.com and password testingtesting123
    Then the user is redirected to page identity/error
