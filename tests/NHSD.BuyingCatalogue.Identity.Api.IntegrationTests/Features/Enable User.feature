Feature: Enable User
    As an Authority User
    I want to be able to enable Users accounts
    So that the user would be able to access the Buying Catalogue

Background:
    Given Organisations exist
        | Name           | OdsCode |
        | Organisation 1 | Ods 1   |
    And Users exist
        | Id  | OrganisationName | FirstName | LastName | Email             | PhoneNumber | Disabled | Password | OrganisationFunction |
        | 123 | Organisation 1   | John      | Doe      | authority@doe.com | 01234567890 | false    | yolo     | Authority            |
